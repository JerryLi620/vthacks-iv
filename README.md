# Moolah Money

## Introduction
Moolah money is a social banking website that allows users to create savings accounts and then see the balances on all their friends' accounts. We thought that peer pressure might do interesting things to the way we bank-- social banking-- if you will. Hopefully, this kind of environment would motivate people to grow their wealth and become more mindful for what they have. We hope Moolah will help people grow their moolah and avoid debt of all kinds.

## How we built it 
Auth0, React.js, Capital One API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Navigating between Capital One's API as well as that of Auth0 was pretty tricky, but we figured out enough for some basic functionality. We are also very happy with the accompanying financial literacy video featured on the resources section of the website.

## What we learned
This was several of ours' first endeavor into API calls as well as React in general. A lot was learned on both those ends. This was all of ours first Hackathon to compete in, so we learned in that regard as well :)
